#Introduction

First, consider the inputs that your algorithm will receive and then what the output should look like. 

#Multiplication

##School algorithm

This algorithm takes each individual digit in the second number and multiplies it with the each digit of the first number.

This means that, for two numbers of length 'n', the number of multplications you must do at least n x n multplications. As a result, the algorithm running time scales quadratically. See L1 notes for Konrad's explanation. 

See Kolmogorov's conjectured that there is no algorithm shorter than the n x n running time of the school algorithm. In other words, that it was asymptotically optimal.  

A week later, Karatsuba found his eponymous algorithm which is also referred to as *divide-and-conquer*.

Al-Khwarizmi is the of the Persian mathematician who derived the arabic numeral system. This became algorisme to describe the system in French and eventually came to describe the system of writing. 

##Divide and conquer

Take the n digit numbers and split them into two n/2 digit numbers. 

This is a recursive algorithm as it calls itself during its running. 

For two numbers of length n (assuming n is a power of two), T(n) = 4 x T(n/2) + k x n for some k \in \mathbb{n}

So T(n) = 4 T(n/2) + kn
	= 4^2 T(n/2^2) + 3kn
	...
	= 4^c T(n/2^c) + (2^c - 1)kn
	= n^2 ( T(1) + k ) - kn
